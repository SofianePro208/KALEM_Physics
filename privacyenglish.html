                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    Welcome to KALEM Physics (the "Platform", "we", "us", "our"). We are committed to protecting the privacy of our visitors and users ("you"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, protect, and disclose your personal information when you visit or use our educational services.
                </p>
                 <p>
                    By using the Platform, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.
                 </p>

                <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>We may collect and process the following types of information about you:</p>

                             <li>User-generated content: If the Platform includes interactive features (like forums or comments), we may collect the content you voluntarily submit.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Information We Collect Automatically:</strong>
                        <ul>
                             <li>Usage and Log Data: We automatically collect information about your interaction with the Platform, including pages visited, features used, lessons viewed, quiz results, access times and dates, and duration spent on different parts of the Platform.</li>
                            <li>Device and Browser Information: We may collect information about the device you use to access the Platform (e.g., device type, operating system, unique device identifiers) and browser information (e.g., browser type, language, approximate IP address).</li>
                            <li>Cookies and Similar Technologies: We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to collect usage information, remember your preferences (like dark mode choice), ensure proper site functioning, and enhance your experience. You can control cookies through your browser settings.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
                <p>We use the information we collect for the following primary purposes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>To Provide, Operate, and Maintain our Services:</strong> To enable you to access and use the Platform, including lessons, quizzes, and other educational content.</li>

                    <li><strong>To Improve and Personalize the Platform:</strong> To understand how users utilize the Platform, identify trends, and improve the Platform's design, functionality, and content. To personalize your experience by showing potentially relevant content.</li>

                     <li><strong>For Security and Legal Compliance:</strong> To protect the security and integrity of the Platform and its users, detect and prevent fraud or unauthorized activities, and comply with our legal obligations.</li>
                     <li><strong>For Analytics and Research:</strong> To perform statistical analysis (in anonymized or aggregated form where possible) to understand and improve the effectiveness of our educational content.</li>
                </ul>

                 <h2>Our Legal Basis for Processing (e.g., for GDPR)</h2>
                 <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), our legal basis for collecting and using the personal information described above will depend on the personal information concerned and the specific context in which we collect it. We will normally collect personal information from you only where we need it to perform a contract with you (e.g., manage your account), where the processing is in our legitimate interests and not overridden by your data protection rights or fundamental freedoms (e.g., improving our services), or where we have your consent to do so.</p>

                 <h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
                 <p>We value your privacy and will not sell or rent your personal information to third parties. We may share your information in the following limited circumstances:</p>
                 <ul>
                     <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may share information with trusted third-party vendors who provide services on our behalf, such as cloud hosting, data analytics, and customer support services. These providers are contractually obligated to protect your information and use it only for the purposes for which we disclose it to them.</li>
                     <li><strong>Legal Compliance and Rights Protection:</strong> We may disclose your information if we believe in good faith that it's necessary to comply with a legal obligation, respond to a valid legal request (like a court order or subpoena), or protect the rights, property, or safety of KALEM Physics, our users, or the public.</li>
                     <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the event of a merger, sale of company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. You will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Platform of any change in ownership or uses of your personal information.</li>
                      <li><strong>Aggregated or Anonymized Data:</strong> We may share aggregated or anonymized information that does not directly identify you for analysis, research, or other business purposes.</li>
                 </ul>

                 <h2>Data Security</h2>
                 <p>
                     We implement reasonable technical, administrative, and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of your personal information from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or disclosure. These include measures like encryption (e.g., HTTPS), access controls, and industry-standard security practices. However, please be aware that no internet transmission or electronic storage method is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information.
                 </p>

                <h2>Data Retention</h2>
                 <p>
                     We will retain your personal information only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as for tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). We will retain and use your usage information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.
                 </p>

                <h2>Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
                 <p>
                     Depending on your location and jurisdiction, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information. These rights may include:

                     <li>The right to request correction of inaccurate or incomplete information.</li>
                     <li>The right to request erasure of your personal information ("right to be forgotten") under certain conditions.</li>

                      <li>The right to withdraw your consent at any time (if processing is based on consent).</li>
                 </ul>
                  <p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the contact details provided below. We may need to verify your identity before processing your request.</p>


                <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>
                   Our Platform is primarily designed for secondary education students, who may be under 18 but are typically over the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13 (or a higher applicable age in some jurisdictions) without verifiable parental consent. If you are a parent or guardian and you discover that your child under 13 has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under the required age without verification of parental consent, we will take steps to remove that information from our servers.
                </p>

                <h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>
                <p>Our Platform may contain links to other websites that are not operated by us. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that third party's site. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of every site you visit. We have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.</p>


                <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>
                     We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date at the top. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
